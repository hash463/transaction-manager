# Expense Tracker

Hello everyone!
Myself Harish Jayaprakash, back again for sharing my project transaction-manager created using flutter. It is integrated with Google Sheets. I have herewith attached the code for Expense Tracker. If you wish to download and run the app, you have to integrate it with your own customized google sheet which can be edited in the "gogle_sheets_api.dart" file. All you need to do is enter your Google Sheets API key and Voila!! There you go.  
Hope you like this design. Thanks for visiting my repository. 

Happy Learning 😁✌️
